# Python Study in 🌱

> ✨✨ <mark><b>Grow</b> your Python skills step by step!</mark> ✨✨

---

## 🎯 **Introduction**

This project is created to **study Python fundamentals** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts 🌱.  
Through practical examples and exercises, I aim to strengthen my skills in:

- 🐍 <mark>**Python syntax and core concepts**</mark> (variables, functions, modules)
- 🏗️ <mark>**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**</mark> (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- 📚 <mark>**Coding best practices**</mark> and **clean code principles**
- 🚀 <mark>**Problem-solving**</mark> with Python

Whether you're just starting out with Python or looking to get more confident with OOP,  
I'm also on this learning journey — so let's grow and improve together! 💪✨  
This repository is where I share structured examples and practice codes as I study step by step 🌱
